# My Flappy Bird: a JavaScript implementation of the famous game

Developing a `Flappy Bird` generic game with pure JavaScript handling the drawing inside a HTML5's [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) structure.

Like any other HTML5 webpage, you can run it on your modern browser of choice, and I recommend [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/). 

So, clone this repo. On your browser, open the `index.html` file following these steps: `File > Open File (Ctrl+O)`, selecting the `index.html` from the directory you chose to clone.

To test it, please just go directly to the [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/thiagojacinto/project/full/DKmErY) project's link.
